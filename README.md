# Rally ICO / Tripmaster GPS with a Raspberry Pico

This project contain the instructions and source code on how to build an *adventure-ready* ICO / Tripmaster to assist a Roadbook using GPS signal. Using the a low-cost Raspberry Pico with a GPS module.

## üéØObjective  
Create a budget friendly navigation solution to enable the participation in motorbike offroad rallies.

## üß≠What are we building?
In short: a GPS-based **compass** and **odometer**.

In long: We'll use the precision of GPS satellites to give you real-time odometry data (so you know how far you've gone) and directional information (so you know you are in the right course) to guide you like a digital roadbook whisperer keeping you on track during a rally event.

#### How it should look like

### The Roadbook
In a rally, you know where you‚Äôre starting, you know where you‚Äôre finishing, but the path in between? That‚Äôs a mystery only the **roadbook** can reveal. This trusty guide holds the instructions for your route ‚Äîbecause just winging it won‚Äôt cut it here. As you tear through the course, you‚Äôll pass through certain key checkpoints to prove you didn‚Äôt accidentally skip a part (the rally organizers are on to you!).

The roadbook itself is a collection of essential instructions: distances, directions (yep, precise degrees), and notes like "don't crash here" (okay, maybe not that specific). All you have to do is follow them, one by one, until you cross that finish line. Simple, right? Well... not really. Getting lost, taking a few *scenic* detours, and doing some U-turns are just part of the fun in these events. But hey, that's what makes it an adventure!

### The ICO / Tripmaster
To master the art of following the roadbook, you‚Äôll need more than just a gut feeling and good luck‚Äîyou need an ICO/Tripmaster. This handy device tells you two critical things: which direction you‚Äôre heading and how far you've gone, so you know exactly when that next instruction is coming (before you drive into oblivion).

And since getting lost is basically a rally rite of passage, the Tripmaster should come with a quick and easy way to reset or adjust your distance. Because, let‚Äôs face it, you‚Äôll probably have to recalibrate after realizing that "this way" was, in fact, the wrong way. But no worries, it‚Äôs all part of the rally charm!
